             <h2 >1. The COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
             <p2>Things that start small can reshape the world. Few people noticed when news emerged last
                  December that China had begun monitoring the outbreak of a new pneumonia-like virus, or
                   even on January 11 after China reported its first death from the disease. </p2>
            <h2 >2. Joe Biden Wins the Presidency</h2>
            <p2>Americans felt passionately about the 2020 presidential election. The proof is in the turnout:
                 More than 159 million people voted. That equates to 66.7 percent voter turnout, the highest since 1900.
                  More than 100 million Americans voted early, either in-person or by mail, the first time in history 
                  that more people voted before Election Day than on it. </p2>
            <h2 >3. China Asserts Itself</h2>
            <p2>“Strategic engagement,” the idea that economic engagement would lead to Beijing becoming “a 
                responsible stakeholder” in world politics, might have met its demise in 2020. China threw its 
                weight around across the globe throughout the year, seemingly not minding whom it offended. </p2>
            <h2 >4. Climate Disruptions Continue</h2>
            <p2>Welcome to the new climate normal: catastrophic wildfires, bigger and more frequent storms,
                 and more intense droughts. The year began with Australia experiencing its worst fire season 
                 on record, with some six percent of the country in flames and nearly three million animals killed.</p2>
            <h2 >5. The Killing of George Floyd</h2>
            <p2>Racism has been called America’s original sin. But it is a sin that extends beyond the United States.
                 On May 25, George Floyd, a forty-six-year-old Black man, was arrested in Minneapolis for allegedly
                  passing a counterfeit $20 bill. </p2>
            <h2 >6. Abraham Accords Signed</h2>
            <p2>A bright spot in 2020 came from the Middle East of all places. On August 13, the Trump administration announced 
                it had helped broker a deal in which the United Arab Emirates (UAE) recognized Israel in return for
                 Israel’s pledge to forgo, for the time being at least, annexing territory in the West Bank. </p2>
            <h2 >7. Oil Prices Tank</h2>
            <p2>Two thousand twenty was not a good year for oil producers or oil companies. The COVID-19 outbreak sent
                 economies around the world into a tailspin, depressing the demand for oil. But the bad news for oil
                  producers didn’t stop there.</p2>
            <h2 >8. Tensions Flare Between Iran and the United States</h2>
            <p2>Bad blood between Tehran and Washington still persists after four decades. On January 3, a U.S. 
                drone strike killed Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary
                 Guard Corps, shortly after he arrived in Baghdad. </p2>
            <h2 >9. Belarusians Protest for Fair and Free Elections</h2>
            <p2>There has been much talk in recent years about the decline of democracy. Belarusians appear not to 
                have gotten the message. On August 9, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, a man known as
                 “Europe’s last dictator,” claimed he had won 80 percent of the vote in the country’s presidential 
                 election, thereby entitling him to a sixth term in office. </p2>
            <h2 >10. The U.S. Senate Acquits Donald Trump of Impeachment Charges</h2>
            <p2>. In most years, a presidential impeachment trial would top the year-end list of biggest news stories.
                 But in 2020, it only just makes the top ten. Donald Trump began the year as the third president in U.S.</p2>
