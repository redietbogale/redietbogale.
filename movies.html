            <h2>1. Small Axe: Lovers Rock</h2>
            <p2>It’s hard to believe that British filmmaker Steve McQueen gave us not one,
                not two, not three … but five new movies this year through his dazzling “Small Axe” 
                anthology. Somehow designed to go straight to streaming (even in a hypothetical non-COVID world) 
                despite their obvious fit to massive cinema screens, this decades-spanning, London-based quintet 
                of films all tell rousing stories about the city’s West Indian community.</p2>
            <h2>2. Nomadland</h2>
            <p2>Chloe Zhao’s “Nomadland” unfolds as a deliberately paced series of observations.
                 As the camera drinks in the gorgeous, sometimes ostentatious views of the outdoors, 
                 Zhao allows us to nonchalantly visit the characters who inhabit this small corner of the universe. </p2>
            <h2>3. David Byrne’s American Utopia</h2>
            <p2>"American Utopia" shows what happens when two pop culture giants at the tops of 
                their respective games finally collaborate, bringing a lifetime of experience to bear, 
                and treating their shared love of live performance as a common language. </p2>
            <h2>4. First Cow</h2>
            <p2>“First Cow” opens in the world of today, and a discovery both unsettling and of some
                 archeological/sociological interest. The narrative is then borne back into the past,
                  and eventually it dawns upon the viewer that the discovery is also a giant spoiler, and wishes it weren’t.</p2>
            <h2>5. Da 5 Bloods</h2>
            <p2>In its soul, Spike Lee's "Da 5 Bloods" is about four Black American soldiers returning 
                to Vietnam to reclaim the bones and wisdom of the man who guided them through war. Stormin’ 
                Norman, played with holy majesty in flashbacks by the late Chadwick Boseman, is the dominating 
                voice of such wisdom in Lee’s gorgeously in-your-face history lesson about how America was never great. </p2>
            <h2>6. Minari</h2>
            <p2>There aren't a million different stories to be told. Most stories, even personal ones, 
                contain familiar elements or come from similar sources. But there are different lenses 
                through which to view the familiar, lenses which expand and transform our "shared" collective 
                memory and/or experience. </p2>
            <h2>7. Beanpole</h2>
            <p2>Kantemir Balagov’s period piece about two Russian women pushing through the debris
                 of World War II and their related trauma was about as depressing as storytelling got 
                 in 2020. Its first major tragedy alone, involving the death of a child, may be too much for some to bear. </p2>
            <h2>8. Never Rarely Sometimes Always</h2>
            <p2>The title is the list of possible answers to a series of sensitive questions a
                 social worker asks a pregnant teenager seeking an abortion. Real-life social
                  worker Kelly Chapman, who assisted writer/director Eliza Hittman with her research 
                  for the film, gently asks Autumn (newcomer Sidney Flanigan) about abuse and consent,
                   in case a safety plan is necessary following the procedure. </p2>
            <h2>9. The Nest</h2>
            <p2>There are scenes in Sean Durkin’s marital drama “The Nest” that are so raw and
                 real, so specific and vivid, you may feel the need to watch them through splayed fingers.
                  As writer and director, he creates the sensation that you’ve wandered into an intimate
                   space where you don’t belong, watching as a husband and wife tear each other apart 
                   with deep-seated resentments and hyperverbal jabs. </p2>
            <h2>10. The Assistant</h2> 
            <p2>Kitty Green’s remarkable “The Assistant” is about #MeToo and Harvey Weinstein without 
                explicitly being about those things. Instead, this quiet, day-in-the-life drama breaks
                 down the many ways employees are forced to tolerate bad behavior. </p2>
